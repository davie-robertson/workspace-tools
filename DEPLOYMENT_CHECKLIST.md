### Deployment Stages Explained

#### Stage 1: Infrastructure Setup (`npm run deploy:setup`)
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes  
**What happens**:
1. **Enables Google Cloud APIs** needed for the application:
   - Cloud Run API (for hosting the application)
   - Cloud Memorystore API (for Redis caching)
   - BigQuery API (for data storage)
   - Secret Manager API (for secure credential storage)
2. **Creates Redis instance** in Cloud Memorystore:
   - Allocates a managed Redis server in Google Cloud
   - Configures network access and security
   - Provides connection details for the application
3. **Creates BigQuery dataset** for persistent data storage:
   - Sets up database tables for file analysis results
   - Configures access permissions and retention policies
   - Establishes connection for the application
4. **Sets up Secret Manager** for secure credential storage:
   - Creates secret containers for sensitive data
   - Configures access permissions for Cloud Run
   - Prepares for manual secret upload in next stage
5. **Configures IAM roles** for service access:
   - Grants Cloud Run access to Redis and BigQuery
   - Sets up service account permissions
   - Ensures secure inter-service communication

**Output**: All cloud infrastructure ready for application deployment

#### Stage 2: Secrets Configuration (Manual Step)
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes  
**What you need to do manually**:
1. **Upload service account key** to Secret Manager:
   ```bash
   gcloud secrets versions add gcp-service-account-key \
     --data-file=./service-account-key.json
   ```
2. **Store configuration values**:
   ```bash
   # Your admin email
   echo "admin@yourdomain.com" | gcloud secrets versions add workspace-admin-user --data-file=-
   
   # Your primary domain
   echo "yourdomain.com" | gcloud secrets versions add workspace-primary-domain --data-file=-
   ```

**Why this is manual**: Sensitive credentials should never be stored in code or automated scripts for security reasons.

**Output**: All sensitive configuration securely stored in Google Cloud

#### Stage 3: Build & Deploy (`npm run deploy:build`)
**Duration**: 3-5 minutes  
**What happens**:
1. **Builds Docker container** with your application:
   - Packages Node.js application into a container image
   - Includes all dependencies and configuration
   - Optimizes image size and security
2. **Pushes image** to Google Container Registry:
   - Uploads container to Google's secure image storage
   - Tags image with version information
   - Makes image available for Cloud Run deployment
3. **Deploys to Cloud Run** with proper configuration:
   - Creates Cloud Run service from container image
   - Configures memory, CPU, and scaling settings
   - Links to Redis, BigQuery, and Secret Manager
4. **Sets up auto-scaling** and health checks:
   - Configures automatic scaling based on traffic
   - Sets up health monitoring and restart policies
   - Ensures high availability and performance
5. **Configures networking** and security:
   - Sets up HTTPS endpoint with SSL certificate
   - Configures firewall rules and access controls
   - Enables secure communication with other services

**Output**: Live application accessible via secure HTTPS URL

#### Stage 4: Validation & Testing
**Duration**: 2-3 minutes  
**What to test**:
1. **Basic connectivity**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-service-url.run.app/health
   ```
2. **Authentication and API access**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-service-url.run.app/api/users
   ```
3. **File scanning functionality**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-service-url.run.app/api/scan/files \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"fileRequests":[{"userEmail":"test@domain.com"}]}'
   ```

**What each test validates**:
- Health check: Basic service functionality and dependencies
- Users endpoint: Google Workspace authentication working
- File scan: End-to-end functionality including caching
