  - Total files scanned by type (Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.)
  - Files containing links
  - Google Sheets with incompatible functions

### Debugging and Logging
- Provides detailed console logs for each step of the process.
- Warns about skipped files (e.g., the output Google Sheet itself).

## Data Transfer and Bandwidth Usage

This tool is designed to be **bandwidth-efficient** and does **not download actual files** during scanning. Instead, it uses Google's export APIs to retrieve structured data:

### What Gets Transferred
- **Google Docs**: Structured JSON containing document text, links, and metadata (via Google Docs API)
- **Google Sheets**: Cell values, formulas, and formatting data (via Google Sheets API)  
- **Google Slides**: Slide content, text, and embedded links (via Google Slides API)
- **File Metadata**: Name, size, permissions, sharing status (via Google Drive API)
- **User Information**: Email addresses, quota data (via Admin SDK and Gmail API)

### Bandwidth Efficiency
- **No file downloads**: The tool never downloads .docx, .xlsx, or .pptx files
- **Small API responses**: Typically 1-10 KB per file (vs. MB for actual files)
- **Quota information**: Drive and Gmail usage data in minimal JSON format
- **Structured data only**: Only the content needed for analysis is retrieved

### Data Transfer Monitoring
The tool includes built-in monitoring that tracks and reports:
- **Total API calls** made during the scan
- **Data transferred** (requests sent + responses received) 
- **Average response size** per API call
- **Scan duration** and efficiency metrics
- **Breakdown by service** (Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Admin, Gmail APIs)

Example output from a typical scan:
```
DATA TRANSFER REPORT
============================================================
Scan Duration: 5.2 seconds
Total API Calls: 15
Total Data Transfer: 47.3 KB
  ‚Üë Requests Sent: 8.1 KB
  ‚Üì Responses Received: 39.2 KB
Average Response Size: 2.6 KB

API Calls by Service:
  DRIVE: 8 calls
  DOCS: 3 calls  
  SHEETS: 2 calls
  ADMIN: 1 calls
  GMAIL: 1 calls
```

This approach allows the tool to scan hundreds or thousands of files while using only a few MB of bandwidth total, making it suitable for large-scale audits without significant network impact.

### Streaming Output for Large Scans

For large-scale scans (1000+ files), the tool uses a **streaming-first architecture** to prevent memory issues and provide real-time progress visibility:

- **Scan Log** (`scan-log.jsonl`): JSONL format file where each file's data is written immediately after processing
- **Summary Log** (`summary-log.jsonl`): JSONL format file tracking user progress, quota data, and scan events  
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Streaming log files are automatically cleaned up after processing is complete
- **Consolidated JSON**: Optional export generated from streaming logs at the end (use `--json-output`)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: View progress by watching the log files during long scans

Benefits of streaming approach:
- ‚úÖ **Memory efficient**: No risk of running out of RAM on large datasets
- ‚úÖ **Progress visibility**: Monitor scan progress in real-time  
- ‚úÖ **Data safety**: Partial results preserved if scan is interrupted
- ‚úÖ **Flexible output**: Can generate traditional JSON or Google Sheets from streaming logs
- ‚úÖ **Clean filesystem**: Log files automatically cleaned up when processing completes

Example streaming output files:
```bash
# Real-time file processing log
scan-log.jsonl          # Each line = one processed file
summary-log.jsonl       # Each line = progress/quota/user event
consolidated-output.json # Final traditional JSON format
```

## Prerequisites
1. **Google Cloud Project**: Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Enable APIs**: Enable these APIs for your project:
   - Admin SDK
   - Google Drive API
   - Google Docs API
   - Google Sheets API
   - Google Slides API
3. **Service Account**:
   - Create a service account and download the JSON key.
   - Grant domain-wide delegation to the service account.
   - In your Google Admin console, add the required OAuth scopes to the service account:
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations.readonly`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` // required for writing to the Google Sheet
4. **Google Sheet**: Create a Google Sheet to store the output. Share it with the service account email.

## Setup
1. **Get the project files**
   - If you have Git installed:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/davie-robertson/workspace-tools.git
     cd workspace-tools
     ```
   - If you do **not** have Git installed:
     1. Go to your repository page on GitHub (or your hosting platform).
     2. Click the green **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**.
     3. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.
     4. Open a terminal and `cd` into the extracted `workspace-tools` directory.
2. **Install Node.js (if not already installed)**
   - This project requires Node.js v18 or newer. You can check your version with:
     ```bash
     node --version
     ```
   - [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):
     ```bash
     nvm install 18
     nvm use 18
     ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Add your service account credentials JSON file**
   - Download the service account JSON key from the Google Cloud Console.
   - Save it in your project directory (for example, as `workspace-scanner-credentials.json`).
   - Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of this file. You can do this in your `.env` file or in your shell before running the script:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./workspace-scanner-credentials.json
     ADMIN_USER=admin@yourdomain.com
     OUTPUT_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
     ```
   - Only the following variables are required in your `.env` file:
     - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (path to your service account JSON file)
     - `ADMIN_USER` (the super admin email for your domain)
     - `OUTPUT_SHEET_ID` (the ID from your Google Sheet's URL)
   - The service account's email and private key are read automatically from the JSON file; you do **not** need to copy them into the `.env` file.
   - If you do not want to use a `.env` file, you can set the environment variable in your shell:
     ```bash
     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./workspace-scanner-credentials.json
     export ADMIN_USER=admin@yourdomain.com
     export OUTPUT_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
     ```

```

## Migration Analysis Features

### File Sharing Analysis
- **External Share Detection**: Identifies files shared with users outside your primary domain
- **Public Link Detection**: Finds files with public or "anyone with link" sharing
- **Cross-Tenant Analysis**: Maps sharing relationships across different Google Workspace tenants
- **Permission Complexity Assessment**: Categorises sharing by migration risk level
- **Domain-Wide Sharing**: Identifies files shared with entire domains

### Drive Location Analysis  
- **Personal vs Shared Drives**: Distinguishes between individual user drives and shared team drives
- **Folder Structure Mapping**: Captures full folder paths for migration planning
- **Orphaned File Detection**: Identifies files without proper folder organisation
- **Migration Complexity Scoring**: Assesses difficulty of moving files based on location and structure

### Calendar Migration Planning
- **Future Events Scanning**: Analyses upcoming events up to 2 years in advance
- **Recurring Meeting Analysis**: Identifies complex recurring patterns that may need special handling
- **External Attendee Detection**: Maps external meeting participants across domains

node index.js --no sharing,drive,calendars    # Multiple features
node index.js --no sharing-analysis,calendars # Mix full names and aliases

```

## Viewing Results
- **Google Sheets**: Open your configured Google Sheet. The script will create multiple tabs with summary and detailed information.
- **JSON Files**: Open the generated JSON file to view structured data that can be processed by other tools.

## Deployment Notes
- This script is intended for use by Google Workspace administrators.
- Make sure the service account has domain-wide delegation and access to the required APIs and users.
- The script processes users and files in batches to avoid API limits - warning messages will be shown if you hit the API quota limits and the script will pause for a few seconds before retrying.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see permission errors, check that:
  - The service account is shared on the output Google Sheet.
  - The service account has domain-wide delegation and the correct OAuth scopes.
  - The `ADMIN_USER` is a super admin in your domain.
- If you see API quota errors, try reducing the batch size or running the script less frequently.
