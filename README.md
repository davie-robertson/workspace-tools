# Google Workspace Migration Analysis Tool

This Node.js (ESM) project is designed for Google Workspace administrators to audit and analyze Google Workspace files (Docs, Sheets, Slides) across their domain. It scans files for links, compatibility issues, and metadata, and outputs results to a Google Sheet or JSON file for further analysis.

**ðŸš€ NEW: Enhanced Migration Analysis Features**
- **File Sharing Analysis**: Identifies external shares, public links, and cross-tenant permissions
- **Drive Location Detection**: Distinguishes personal drives vs shared drives and folder structures  
- **Calendar Migration Planning**: Scans future events, recurring meetings, and external attendees
- **Migration Risk Assessment**: Automatically categorizes files and events by migration complexity

## Features

## Additional Features

### File Metadata Retrieval
- Retrieves detailed metadata for each file, including:
  - File ID, name, and MIME type
  - Web view link for easy access
  - Owners' email addresses
  - Creation and modification timestamps
  - File size (for non-Google Workspace files)
  - Permissions and sharing status

### JSON Output Enhancements
- Supports appending new scan results to an existing JSON file, merging statistics and file lists.
- Includes detailed summaries of:
  - Total files scanned by type (Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.)
  - Files containing links
  - Google Sheets with incompatible functions

### Debugging and Logging
- Provides detailed console logs for each step of the process.
- Warns about skipped files (e.g., the output Google Sheet itself).

## Data Transfer and Bandwidth Usage

This tool is designed to be **bandwidth-efficient** and does **not download actual files** during scanning. Instead, it uses Google's export APIs to retrieve structured data:

### What Gets Transferred
- **Google Docs**: Structured JSON containing document text, links, and metadata (via Google Docs API)
- **Google Sheets**: Cell values, formulas, and formatting data (via Google Sheets API)  
- **Google Slides**: Slide content, text, and embedded links (via Google Slides API)
- **File Metadata**: Name, size, permissions, sharing status (via Google Drive API)
- **User Information**: Email addresses, quota data (via Admin SDK and Gmail API)

### Bandwidth Efficiency
- **No file downloads**: The tool never downloads .docx, .xlsx, or .pptx files
- **Small API responses**: Typically 1-10 KB per file (vs. MB for actual files)
- **Quota information**: Drive and Gmail usage data in minimal JSON format
- **Structured data only**: Only the content needed for analysis is retrieved

### Data Transfer Monitoring
The tool includes built-in monitoring that tracks and reports:
- **Total API calls** made during the scan
- **Data transferred** (requests sent + responses received) 
- **Average response size** per API call
- **Scan duration** and efficiency metrics
- **Breakdown by service** (Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Admin, Gmail APIs)

Example output from a typical scan:
```
DATA TRANSFER REPORT
============================================================
Scan Duration: 5.2 seconds
Total API Calls: 15
Total Data Transfer: 47.3 KB
  â†‘ Requests Sent: 8.1 KB
  â†“ Responses Received: 39.2 KB
Average Response Size: 2.6 KB

API Calls by Service:
  DRIVE: 8 calls
  DOCS: 3 calls  
  SHEETS: 2 calls
  ADMIN: 1 calls
  GMAIL: 1 calls
```

This approach allows the tool to scan hundreds or thousands of files while using only a few MB of bandwidth total, making it suitable for large-scale audits without significant network impact.

### Streaming Output for Large Scans

For large-scale scans (1000+ files), the tool uses a **streaming-first architecture** to prevent memory issues and provide real-time progress visibility:

- **Scan Log** (`scan-log.jsonl`): JSONL format file where each file's data is written immediately after processing
- **Summary Log** (`summary-log.jsonl`): JSONL format file tracking user progress, quota data, and scan events  
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Streaming log files are automatically cleaned up after processing is complete
- **Consolidated JSON**: Optional export generated from streaming logs at the end (use `--json-output`)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: View progress by watching the log files during long scans

Benefits of streaming approach:
- âœ… **Memory efficient**: No risk of running out of RAM on large datasets
- âœ… **Progress visibility**: Monitor scan progress in real-time  
- âœ… **Data safety**: Partial results preserved if scan is interrupted
- âœ… **Flexible output**: Can generate traditional JSON or Google Sheets from streaming logs
- âœ… **Clean filesystem**: Log files automatically cleaned up when processing completes

Example streaming output files:
```bash
# Real-time file processing log
scan-log.jsonl          # Each line = one processed file
summary-log.jsonl       # Each line = progress/quota/user event
consolidated-output.json # Final traditional JSON format
```

## Prerequisites
1. **Google Cloud Project**: Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Enable APIs**: Enable these APIs for your project:
   - Admin SDK
   - Google Drive API
   - Google Docs API
   - Google Sheets API
   - Google Slides API
3. **Service Account**:
   - Create a service account and download the JSON key.
   - Grant domain-wide delegation to the service account.
   - In your Google Admin console, add the required OAuth scopes to the service account:
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations.readonly`
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` // required for writing to the Google Sheet
4. **Google Sheet**: Create a Google Sheet to store the output. Share it with the service account email.

## Setup
1. **Get the project files**
   - If you have Git installed:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/davie-robertson/workspace-tools.git
     cd workspace-tools
     ```
   - If you do **not** have Git installed:
     1. Go to your repository page on GitHub (or your hosting platform).
     2. Click the green **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**.
     3. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.
     4. Open a terminal and `cd` into the extracted `workspace-tools` directory.
2. **Install Node.js (if not already installed)**
   - This project requires Node.js v18 or newer. You can check your version with:
     ```bash
     node --version
     ```
   - [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):
     ```bash
     nvm install 18
     nvm use 18
     ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Add your service account credentials JSON file**
   - Download the service account JSON key from the Google Cloud Console.
   - Save it in your project directory (for example, as `workspace-scanner-credentials.json`).
   - Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of this file. You can do this in your `.env` file or in your shell before running the script:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./workspace-scanner-credentials.json
     ADMIN_USER=admin@yourdomain.com
     OUTPUT_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
     ```
   - Only the following variables are required in your `.env` file:
     - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (path to your service account JSON file)
     - `ADMIN_USER` (the super admin email for your domain)
     - `OUTPUT_SHEET_ID` (the ID from your Google Sheet's URL)
   - The service account's email and private key are read automatically from the JSON file; you do **not** need to copy them into the `.env` file.
   - If you do not want to use a `.env` file, you can set the environment variable in your shell:
     ```bash
     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./workspace-scanner-credentials.json
     export ADMIN_USER=admin@yourdomain.com
     export OUTPUT_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
     ```

```

## Viewing Results
- **Google Sheets**: Open your configured Google Sheet. The script will create multiple tabs with summary and detailed information.
- **JSON Files**: Open the generated JSON file to view structured data that can be processed by other tools.

## Deployment Notes
- This script is intended for use by Google Workspace administrators.
- Make sure the service account has domain-wide delegation and access to the required APIs and users.
- The script processes users and files in batches to avoid API limits - warning messages will be shown if you hit the API quota limits and the script will pause for a few seconds before retrying.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see permission errors, check that:
  - The service account is shared on the output Google Sheet.
  - The service account has domain-wide delegation and the correct OAuth scopes.
  - The `ADMIN_USER` is a super admin in your domain.
- If you see API quota errors, try reducing the batch size or running the script less frequently.
